CrewAI allows us to create specialized agents that can work together to handle different aspects of the RAG workflow, from document retrieval to response generation. This tutorial is designed to be beginner-friendly, with clear, step-by-step instructions that will equip you with the knowledge to create a fully functional semantic search system from scratch.\n",

        "Once you've run your `process_query` function a few times (especially after the first run to allow Arize to set up the schema for your `MODEL_ID`), you can log into your Arize AI account to see the observability data.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Steps to View Data:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Log in to Arize AI:** Go to [app.arize.com](https://app.arize.com/) and log in.\n",
        "2.  **Navigate to Your Model:**\n",
        "    *   Find the Space you used (identified by your `ARIZE_SPACE_KEY`).\n",
        "    *   Within that Space, you should see your model, which we named `crew-ai-rag-app` (or whatever `MODEL_ID` you configured). Click on it.\n",
        "    *   If it's the first time sending data for this model, Arize might prompt you to **review and accept the schema**. This is where Arize understands the structure of your features (e.g., `query_text`) and predictions (e.g., `final_response`). Accept the schema to proceed. This might take a few minutes to appear after the first data is sent.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Explore the Data:**\n",
        "    *   **Overview Tab:** Get a general summary of your model's performance, including prediction volumes and any detected drifts or issues (once you have more data).\n",
        "    *   **Data Ingestion Tab:** Check the status of data being sent to Arize. You can see batches of data and any potential ingestion errors.\n",
        "    *   **Prompt Playground & Tracing (for LLMs):** This is where the `ArizeCallbackHandler` data shines.\n",
        "        *   You should be able to find individual traces for LLM calls made by your agents.\n",
        "        *   Look for sections related to \"Prompts\" or \"Traces\".\n",
        "        *   You can inspect the exact prompts sent to the LLM, the responses received, token counts, and latencies for each step in your agent's reasoning process.\n",
        "        *   This is invaluable for debugging prompts, understanding agent behavior, and identifying performance bottlenecks.\n",
        "    *   **Predictions Table:** View the explicit logs you sent using `arize_client.log()`. You'll see your `prediction_id`, `features` (like `query_text`), `prediction_label` (the `final_response`), and any `tags` you added (like `crew_execution_time_seconds`).\n",
        "    *   **Embeddings (if applicable):** If you were logging embeddings (not explicitly covered in this basic setup but possible with Arize), you could visualize them here.\n",

        "**What to Look For:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Prompt-Response Pairs:** Are the prompts what you expect? Are the LLM responses sensible?\n",
        "*   **Latency:** How long is each LLM call taking? Where are the delays in your crew's execution?\n",
        "*   **Token Usage:** Monitor token consumption to manage costs and stay within context limits.\n",
        "*   **Errors:** The `ArizeCallbackHandler` should also log errors from LLM calls. Explicitly logged errors (like our `crew_error` example) will also appear.\n",
        "*   **Overall Flow:** By correlating the `prediction_id` from your explicit log with the traces from the `ArizeCallbackHandler`, you can piece together the entire journey of a query through your CrewAI application.\n",

Unlike the FTS index, which is used for text-based search, the vector store is specifically designed to handle embeddings and perform similarity searches.

This allows the engine to find documents that are semantically similar to the query, even if they don't contain the exact same words. By setting up the vector store in Couchbase, we create a powerful tool that enables our search engine to understand and retrieve information based on the meaning and context of the query, rather than just the specific words used."
